3. An array is called centered-15 if some consecutive sequence of elements of the array sum to
15 and this sequence is preceded and followed by the same number of elements. For example
{3, 2, 10, 4, 1, 6, 9} is centered-15 because the sequence 10, 4, 1 sums to 15 and the
sequence is preceded by two elements (3, 2) and followed by two elements(6,9).
Write a method called isCentered15 that returns 1 if its array argument is centered-15, otherwise
it returns 0.
If you are programming in Java or C#, the function prototype is
int isCentered15(int[ ] a)
If you are programming in C++ or C, the function prototype is
int isCentered5(int a[ ], int len) where len is the number of elements in the array.
Examples
if a is retur
n
reason
{3, 2, 10, 4, 1, 6, 9} 1 the sequence 10, 4, 1 sums to 15 and is
preceded by 2 elements and followed by 2
elements. Note that there is another sequence
that sums to 15 (6,9}. It is okay for the array to
have more than one sequence that sums to 15
as long as at least one of them is centered.
{2, 10, 4, 1, 6, 9} 0 (10, 4, 1) is preceded by one element but
followed by two. (9,6) is preceded by fve
elements but followed by none. Hence neither
qualify as centered.
{3, 2, 10, 4, 1, 6} (10, 4, 1) is preceded by two elements but
followed by one. Note that the values 3, 2, 4, 6
sum to 15 but they are not consecutive.
{1,1,8, 3, 1, 1} The entire array sums to 15, hence the
sequence is preceded by zero elements and
followed by zero elements.
{9, 15, 6} 1 the sequence (15) is preceded by one element
and followed by one element.
{1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1} 0 no sequence sums to 15.
{1, 1, 15 -1,-1} 1 there are three diï¬€erent sequences that sum to
15, the entire array, (1, 15, -1) and (15). In this
case they all are centered but the requirement
is that just one of them has to be.
